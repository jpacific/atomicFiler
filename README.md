Collects Students' class information in a format that can be easily imported into a spreadsheet.

Instructor Pre-Collection Directions:
We are going to build a File Structure that contains all the Periods that you teach.
1. Create a Directory to contain all of the Periods that you will be collecting information for. You can name
   this however you like. (This is optional, however, you can be more organized this way.)
2. Now, create a Directory for each Period that you will be collecting information for. Name these Directories in the
   the format that you like and how you want them to be in a spreadsheet. (Ex: First, Second, 1st, 2nd, etc)

Student Pre-Collection Directions:
1. Instruct your Students to go to the Directory of their Period.
2. Following that, have them create a text file with their name as the filename.
3. Instruct the Students to type their email address on the first line of the text file, save the file, and exit.
   No other text should be in the file besides their email address.

Colletion Directions:
1. Select 'Select Period' and navigate to the Class Period that you want to collect information from.
2. Select 'Select Output Directory' and navigate to the Directory that you want to contain the text file that you can
   import into a spreadsheet.
3. Click the 'Gather Info!' button and enjoy the time saved from having to click through each file and manually collect the
   emails!
